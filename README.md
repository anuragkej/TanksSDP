# TanksSDP
Created a Tanks game along with a partner that utilizes the C++ Proteus Libraries.
- Created a full interactive menu UI with 4 options for the user:
   * Start
   * Instructions
   * Statistics
   * Credits
- Used Makefile and Simulator Libraries.
- Created a website showcasing the entire project alongside partner.  

Proposed Elements:
* Random Generation
  * Random generation is used to display one of the 5 quotes at the start of the game, as well as to decide whether the opponent’s tank gets hit.
* Gravity Effects
  * Projectiles speed up on the way down due to gravity.
* Projectiles
  * Tanks fire projectiles at opposing tanks.
* Multiplayer mode
  * Two player mode where each person controls one of the tanks.
